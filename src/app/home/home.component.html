    <p>Hi there! I'm Jernej Klancic, a passionate developer and engineering manager. My love for technology began with a Commodore 64 in childhood and has only grown stronger. Through living in various countries, I've broadened my horizons and applied diverse life experiences to my career in software engineering and management.</p>
    <p>Since August 2023, I've embraced a new challenge as an engineering manager. This role allows me to combine my technical expertise in Java, JavaScript, and C# with business acumen. I use my experience to mentor and guide engineers, focusing on their growth into exceptional professionals. Despite the shift in responsibilities, I maintain my curiosity and continue to code in my free time, keeping my technical skills sharp.</p>
